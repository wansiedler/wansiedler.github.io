## 🚀 Node.js Experience

Since **2009**, I’ve actively worked with **Node.js**, starting from its earliest versions, when the ecosystem was still in its infancy. My passion for the platform began with its **simplicity and asynchronous nature**, which made it ideal for building **high-performance, scalable applications**.

Over the years, I’ve grown with Node.js through its major phases — from **callbacks and events**, to **Promises**, and eventually **async/await**.  
In early projects, I utilized **Express.js**, integrating databases like **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**, honing deep expertise in **async programming**, **error handling**, and **stream-based processing**.

As the ecosystem matured, I embraced modern frameworks and tooling:

- Adopted **Express.js**, **Next.js** and **NestJS** for more structured backend applications
- Designed resilient **microservices** with **Fastify** and **Prisma**
- Architected systems using **GraphQL** (Apollo, Mercurius), **gRPC**, and **WebSockets** (Socket.IO, uWebSockets.js)
- Leveraged tools like **BullMQ**, **Bree**, and **Agenda** for job queues
- Integrated DevOps workflows using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **ArgoCD**, and **OpenTelemetry**
- Built full-fledged frontends using **React/Next.js**, **Vue/Nuxt.js**, **Angular**, and UI systems like **Tailwind**, **MUI**, and **ShadCN**

Currently, I continue to use Node.js extensively to build **high-load APIs**, **distributed systems**, and **developer tooling** — applying best practices such as **SOLID**, **KISS**, and **YAGNI** in every implementation.
