# Senior Python Backend Engineer

I am a **Senior Python Backend Engineer** with extensive experience in building high-load, fault-tolerant, and scalable systems. My expertise spans the full software lifecycle—from architectural design to deployment and maintenance in production environments.

---

## 🏗 Architecture & Backend Development

I have a deep understanding of distributed systems, microservice architectures, and high-performance backend solutions. I actively use:

- **Python** — my primary language for building reliable, secure, and maintainable backend services
- **FastAPI / Starlette** — modern async frameworks for building high-performance APIs with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Django / Django REST Framework (DRF)** — for building full-featured web apps and robust REST APIs
- **GraphQL** — via `Graphene` or `Strawberry`, enabling flexible client-server interactions
- **gRPC** — for efficient service communication, using `grpcio` and `protobuf`

---

## 📦 Frameworks & Libraries

I work with a wide range of tools and libraries that accelerate development and ensure maintainable code:

- **FastAPI, Starlette, Flask** — async-first or lightweight frameworks for APIs and microservices
- **Django, DRF** — batteries-included frameworks for full-stack or API-first applications
- **SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM, Django ORM** — ORMs with deep knowledge of raw SQL, optimization, and migrations
- **Alembic** — for database migrations and schema management
- **Pydantic** — for data validation and serialization
- **Click, Typer** — for building CLI tools
- **Dependency Injector** — robust dependency injection container for Python

---

## 🗄 Databases & Storage

Experience with both relational and NoSQL databases:

- **PostgreSQL, MySQL** — schema design, indexing, partitioning, replication
- **Redis, Memcached** — caching, rate-limiting, background job support
- **MongoDB, ClickHouse** — document storage and analytical queries
- **SQLite** — used for local development and embedded setups

---

## 🕸 Asynchronous Processing & Queues

I design systems that handle asynchronous and event-driven workloads:

- **Celery / RQ / Dramatiq** — background job queues with retry logic, task routing, and scheduling
- **RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka, NATS** — message brokers and streaming systems for inter-service communication
- **Temporal (Python SDK), Apache Airflow** — for workflows and complex job orchestration
- **FastAPI WebSockets / Socket.IO** — for real-time data processing

---

## 🌍 Cloud Technologies & DevOps

My services are built with automation, resilience, and scalability in mind:

- **Docker, Kubernetes (K8s, K3s), Helm** — containerization and orchestration
- **Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible** — Infrastructure as Code and configuration management
- **AWS (Lambda, ECS, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch), GCP, Azure** — cloud-native architecture
- **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins** — pipelines for testing and deployment
- **OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Sentry** — monitoring, observability, and incident response

---

## 🔥 Optimization & Security

I write efficient, secure code with a strong focus on best practices:

- **cProfile, Py-spy, line_profiler** — profiling and performance tuning
- **asyncio, multiprocessing, threading** — concurrency primitives
- **OWASP, Bandit, pyjwt, authlib** — security practices: protection against SQLi, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, JWT, OAuth2

## 🎯 Why Python?

Python is not just a language—it's an ecosystem for rapid, readable, and powerful backend development. I love its expressive syntax, mature libraries, and strong community support. Whether I'm building REST APIs, microservices, or distributed systems, Python enables me to move fast without sacrificing robustness. I'm passionate about leveraging Python to build the next generation of resilient, cloud-native backend systems.
