# Senior Go Engineer

Im in love/hate relationship with Go and K8s.

I am a **Senior Go Engineer** with many years of experience in developing high-load, fault-tolerant, and scalable systems. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle—from architecture design to final deployment and production support.

---

## 🏗 Architecture & Backend Development

I have a deep understanding of building distributed systems, microservices architecture, and high-load solutions. In my work, I actively use:

- **Go (Golang)** — my primary programming language, used to build reliable, high-performance, and secure services
- **gRPC** — for high-performance service communication, using Protobuf and well-structured API schemas
- **REST API** — designed following best practices and documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **GraphQL** — for flexible client-server interaction, including usage with `gqlgen`

---

## 📦 Frameworks & Libraries

I’ve worked with various frameworks and tools that accelerate development and ensure high code reliability:

- **Gin, Fiber** — lightweight and fast HTTP frameworks for RESTful APIs
- **Echo, Chi** — alternatives with convenient routing and middleware support
- **gorm, ent** — ORMs for working with databases; I also write raw SQL and optimize queries
- **sqlc** — generates Go code based on SQL queries
- **Wire, Fx** — DI frameworks for efficient dependency management
- **Cobra, Viper** — for building CLI apps and flexible service configuration

---

## 🗄 Databases & Storage

I have experience with both relational and NoSQL databases:

- **PostgreSQL, MySQL** — configuration, indexing, sharding, replication
- **Redis, Memcached** — caching and streaming data processing
- **MongoDB, ClickHouse** — for document storage and analytics
- **BadgerDB, BoltDB** — embedded storage for high-performance solutions

---

## 🕸 Asynchronous Processing & Queues

I develop high-load services using message brokers and event-driven architecture:

- **Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ** — reliable inter-service message delivery
- **Apache Pulsar, Google Pub/Sub** — event streaming in cloud and hybrid environments
- **Temporal, Celery (Go bindings)** — workflow and distributed task management

---

## 🌍 Cloud Technologies & DevOps

My services run in cloud environments with automated CI/CD:

- **Docker, Kubernetes (K8s, K3s, OpenShift)** — containerization, orchestration, Helm charts
- **Terraform, Pulumi** — Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch), GCP, Azure** — building cloud-native solutions
- **GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions** — test and deployment automation
- **OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki** — monitoring, logging, and tracing

---

## 🔥 Optimization & Security

I write high-performance and secure code, following best practices:

- **pprof, Go Benchmarking** — performance analysis and optimization
- **Mutex, atomic, sync.Pool** — concurrency handling and allocation reduction
- **OWASP, gosec** — security: protection against SQLi, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, JWT, and OAuth 2.0

## 🎯 Why Go?

Go is more than just a programming language—it's a philosophy of simplicity, reliability, and performance. I appreciate its strict typing, built-in garbage collector, and powerful concurrency primitives. I see how Go is transforming the industry and I’m ready to build complex systems that change the game.
